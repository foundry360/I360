## Assessment Framework & Deliverable Structure

Generate a comprehensive GTM Readiness Assessment structured according to the GtmReadinessOutputSchema with the following components:

### Executive Summary
- **Overall GTM Readiness Score** (0-100) with methodology
- **Strategic Findings Summary** with critical insights
- **Priority Action Areas** with impact assessment
- **Investment Requirements** and expected ROI

### Current State Analysis
Conduct deep-dive assessment across five core dimensions:

1. **Organizational Readiness** (People, Process, Governance)
2. **Technology & Data Infrastructure** (Systems, Integration, Analytics)
3. **Customer Experience & Market Position** (ICP, Value Prop, Journey)
4. **Revenue Operations Excellence** (Process, Forecasting, Metrics)
5. **Performance & Growth Metrics** (KPIs, Trends, Benchmarking)

### Gap Analysis & Risk Assessment
- **Critical capability gaps** with business impact quantification
- **Process inefficiencies** and cost implications
- **Technology debt** and integration challenges
- **Organizational risks** and change readiness barriers

### Strategic Recommendations
**Priority 1 (0-3 months):** Foundation & Quick Wins
**Priority 2 (3-9 months):** Process Optimization & Integration
**Priority 3 (9-18 months):** Advanced Capabilities & Scale

Each recommendation must include:
- Business case and ROI projection
- Implementation timeline and milestones
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Professional Standards & Output Requirements

**Analytical Rigor:**
- Base all assessments on quantitative data analysis
- Provide industry benchmarking context where applicable
- Include confidence intervals and data quality notes
- Use statistical significance testing for performance metrics

**Professional Presentation:**
- Executive-level language and tone
- Clear, actionable insights with supporting evidence
- Professional formatting with proper markdown structure
- Consistent terminology and methodology

**CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**

For all long-form content fields, you **MUST** use professional business report formatting:

- Use **BOLD TEXT** for main headers and section titles
- Use **Bold Text** for subheaders and key topic areas
- Write content in clear, structured paragraphs with professional prose
- **MANDATORY:** Include literal newline characters (\\\\n) between:
  - Headers and content
  - Paragraphs
  - Section breaks
  - Any content blocks

**Example proper formatting:**
'''
**MARKET POSITION ANALYSIS**\\\\n\\\\nThe company demonstrates strong competitive positioning in three key areas. Product differentiation shows clear value proposition with measurable ROI, while market timing indicates early mover advantage in emerging segment. Customer validation through high NPS scores confirms product-market fit.\\\\n\\\\n**Technology Infrastructure Assessment**\\\\n\\\\nCurrent state reveals significant opportunities for optimization across systems integration and data management capabilities. **Data Management Capabilities** require immediate attention with current hygiene practices showing gaps in lead qualification processes.\\\\n\\\\nThe technology stack demonstrates moderate satisfaction levels...
'''

**Failure to include proper \`\\\\\\\\n\` characters will result in formatting errors and unprofessional presentation.**

## Delivery Excellence Standards
